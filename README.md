GlucoMind Analysis

GlucoMind Analysis is a comprehensive data science project for analyzing and predicting glucose-related health metrics. The notebook walks through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and selection of the best-performing model. It‚Äôs designed for researchers, data scientists, or healthcare professionals working on glucose or diabetes-related studies.

üìå Features

Data Import & Cleaning: Handles missing values and formats raw glucose data for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics: Summarizes key metrics and distributions.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generates insightful plots (correlation heatmaps, histograms, and trend visualizations).

Machine Learning Models: Implements and compares multiple models (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).

Model Evaluation: Uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualization of actual vs. predicted values.

Model Saving: Exports the best model as a .pkl file for future deployment.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scipy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, tensorflow, joblib, pickle
